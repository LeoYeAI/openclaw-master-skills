## ⚠️ EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY

**crypto-sniper-oracle** (optional — enriches signals with OBI/VWAP data)

- **Source:** https://github.com/georges91560/crypto-sniper-oracle
- **Purpose:** Provides order book imbalance, VWAP, and microstructure analysis
- **Execution:** Called via subprocess during market scanning
- **Security:** MUST be audited before installation (external code execution)

**What it does:**
- Fetches Binance market data
- Calculates order book metrics
- Returns JSON signals
- NO credential requirements
- NO network calls except Binance

**Installation instructions in CONFIGURATION.md**

---

## 🤖 Pre-Installation Check (Terminal / Hostinger)

> **Why pre-install?** The script is 1722 lines. Pre-installing it on the server means the AI agent never needs to recreate it from scratch — it launches in seconds and loads its learned memory immediately. Overwriting an existing install would erase `learned_config.json` and `performance_metrics.json` — the bot's brain.

**Always run this check first:**

```bash
# Check if already installed
ls /workspace/skills/crypto-executor/executor.py

# ✅ Already installed → just launch:
source /etc/crypto-executor/credentials.env
python3 /workspace/skills/crypto-executor/executor.py

# ❌ Not installed → full install (run once):
mkdir -p /workspace/skills/crypto-executor /workspace/reports/daily /workspace/config_history
cd /workspace/skills
git clone https://github.com/georges91560/crypto-executor.git crypto-executor-repo
# SECURITY: pin a specific commit instead of HEAD — verify tag on GitHub first
# git checkout <commit-hash-or-tag>
cp crypto-executor-repo/executor.py /workspace/skills/crypto-executor/executor.py  # filename is lowercase
pip install websocket-client --break-system-packages
# On VPS/standard server: prefer → python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install websocket-client

# Verify before launch
python3 -c "
import os; from pathlib import Path
checks = {
    'executor.py': Path('/workspace/skills/crypto-executor/executor.py').exists(),
    'oracle':      Path('/workspace/skills/crypto-sniper-oracle/crypto_oracle.py').exists(),
    'API_KEY':     bool(os.getenv('BINANCE_API_KEY')),
    'API_SECRET':  bool(os.getenv('BINANCE_API_SECRET')),
}
[print(('✅' if v else '❌') + ' ' + k) for k,v in checks.items()]
print('READY — run executor.py' if all(checks.values()) else 'FIX ABOVE FIRST')
"
```

## 🔥 COMPLETE FEATURES

### **1. WebSocket Real-Time Streaming**

```python
# With websocket-client installed (recommended):
pip install websocket-client --break-system-packages
# On VPS/standard server: prefer → python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install websocket-client
# → Sub-100ms updates via wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/
# → Auto-reconnect on disconnect
# → Ping keepalive every 20s

# Without websocket-client (fallback automatic):
# → REST polling every 1s
# → No config needed, bot works normally

# Benefits vs v1.0:
- 300x faster position monitoring
- Instant stop loss execution
- bid/ask spread available in cache
```

---

### **2. OCO Orders (One-Cancels-Other)**

```python
# Binance manages TP/SL automatically
Entry: Market BUY executed
↓
OCO order created instantly:
├─ Take Profit: Binance sells at TP
└─ Stop Loss: Binance sells at SL

# When TP hits → SL cancels
# When SL hits → TP cancels
# Zero lag, managed by Binance

# v2.3 addition: OCO monitoring
# Bot detects when Binance closes position
# → Updates portfolio, Kelly, performance metrics instantly
```

**Protection window:**
- v1.0: Up to 5 minutes unprotected
- v2.3: <1 second protection ✅

---

### **3. Kelly Criterion Position Sizing**

```python
# Adaptive position sizing based on performance
kelly = (win_rate × avg_win - (1 - win_rate) × avg_loss) / avg_win

# Example:
Win rate: 85%
Avg win: +0.3%
Avg loss: -0.5%

Kelly = (0.85 × 0.003 - 0.15 × 0.005) / 0.003
      = 0.60 (60% of capital suggested)

# Use 50% Kelly (conservative default)
Position size = 60% × 0.5 × signal_confidence

# Adapts automatically as performance changes!
# Default: 60% (prudent start, no history)
```

**Benefits:**
- Increases size when winning
- Reduces size when losing
- Optimal growth rate (mathematically proven)

---

### **4. Trailing Stops (Lock Profits)**

```python
# Automatically lock profits as price moves up
Entry: $45,000

Price reaches $45,450 (+1%)
→ Trailing stop: $45,000 (breakeven)

Price reaches $45,900 (+2%)
→ Trailing stop: $45,450 (lock +1%)

Price reaches $46,350 (+3%)
→ Trailing stop: $45,900 (lock +2%)

# Lets winners run, protects gains!
```

**Impact:**
- v1.0: Fixed TP at +0.3%, missed big moves
- v2.3: Captures +1% to +5% on strong trends ✅

---

### **5. Circuit Breakers (4-Level Protection)**

```python
# Level 1: Daily Loss Limit
Daily loss > 2%
→ Pause trading for 2 hours
→ Auto-resume

# Level 2: Weekly Loss Limit
Weekly loss > 5%
→ Reduce position sizes by 50%
→ Conservative mode active

# Level 3: Drawdown Pause
Drawdown > 7%
→ Pause trading for 48 hours
→ Manual review required

# Level 4: Kill Switch
Drawdown > 10%
→ STOP ALL TRADING
→ Manual restart only
```

**Maximum possible loss:** 10% (kill switch prevents catastrophe)

---

### **6. Daily Performance Reports**

```python
# Generated at 9am UTC every day
# Sent via Telegram

├─ Total equity
├─ Daily P&L ($, %)

### **7. Parallel Market Scanning**

```python
# 10 symbols scanned simultaneously
ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10)

v1.0: Sequential → 5 symbols × 500ms = 5000ms
v2.3: Parallel   → 10 symbols × 500ms = 500ms (10x faster)

# Symbols scanned:
PRIMARY:   BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, BNBUSDT, SOLUSDT, ADAUSDT
SECONDARY: DOGEUSDT, MATICUSDT, AVAXUSDT, DOTUSDT, LINKUSDT
```

---

```
