# Bot Arcade — Economy & Progression System

A comprehensive guide to the virtual economy, progression mechanics,
and behavioral psychology powering the Arcade's engagement engine.

---

## VIRTUAL CURRENCY: ARCADE COINS 🪙

### Design Philosophy
Arcade Coins are the universal currency. They are:
- **Abundant enough** to feel rewarding (players should earn steadily)
- **Scarce enough** to feel valuable (big purchases require effort)
- **Transparent** in earning and spending (no hidden mechanics)

### Inflation Control
To prevent currency inflation over time:
1. **Coin sinks** — Cosmetics, tournament entries, and premium features
   remove coins from circulation
2. **Scaling costs** — Higher-level cosmetics cost exponentially more
3. **Daily caps** — Maximum 500 coins earnable per day from free games
4. **Decay prevention** — Coins don't expire (anti-frustration measure)

### Exchange Rates (for operators enabling real-currency features)
| Platform Currency | Arcade Coins |
|------------------|-------------|
| 1 Telegram Star | 50 🪙 |
| $1 USD | 500 🪙 |
| Free daily login | 10 🪙 |

## BEHAVIORAL PSYCHOLOGY HOOKS

### Variable Ratio Reinforcement
The most addictive reward schedule. Slots and fortune drops use this:
- Players never know WHEN the next reward hits
- Each attempt could be "the one"
- Near-misses amplify the urge to try again

### Loss Aversion (Streaks)
Players fear losing their streak more than they desire the daily bonus.
This drives consistent daily engagement without feeling forced.

### Endowment Effect (Collections)
Once players have 80/100 fortunes collected, they feel compelled to
complete the set. The missing pieces feel more valuable than what they have.

### Social Proof (Leaderboards)
Seeing others win and climb motivates participation. "If they can do it,
I can too." Especially effective when friends are on the leaderboard.

### Sunk Cost (Progression)
A Level 17 player with 23 achievements won't abandon their profile.
The time invested creates loyalty to the platform.

### Peak-End Rule (Session Design)
End every session on a high note:
- Show total earnings for the session
- Preview tomorrow's daily challenge
- Tease upcoming events or unlocks
- "You're only 200 XP from Level 18!"

### IKEA Effect (Boss Raids)
Players value victories they worked hard for. Boss raids take effort,
making the reward feel more meaningful than a slot win.
